# Introduction #

For those who could style a website with CSS3 using modern browsers and get amazed with its evolution, probably got frustated with all Internet Explorer's versions not accepting its features and even part or none of its selectors (read IE6). I don't like to stopgap anything but I got the conclusion that Internet Explorer should not be our limit for the web. I usually even refuse to call it as a browser considering that browsers are supposed to follow W3C rules or at least work as it demands. With the intention to keep what I did for all browsers the most intact as I could and considering that IE itself it's not compatible with the modern internet and not my websites incompatible with IE, I created a code that helps IE to read CSS3 selectors without making a big change in the original HTML and stylesheets.

This code doesn't make CSS3 properties to work in Internet Explorer. It only helps IE to recognize the selectors.
