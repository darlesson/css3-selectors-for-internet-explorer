# Introduction #

This a project used to get modern websites using CSS3, compatible with Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8. This code doesn't make CSS3 properties to work in Internet Explorer. It only helps IE to recognize the selectors with jQuery's help.

Considering this is an old project dating back to 2009, you might need to verify if this implementation is good for your project, and whether there is any performance issue.
